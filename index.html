                    services they use can be trusted.</p>

            <h4>What is Agile AI Governance?</h4>
            <p>AI can deliver great value, but carries a risk of incorrect or biassed decisions hurting customers, data
                subjects -- or your business. This is why legislators, regulators, and customers increasingly demand
                proof they
                can trust the models behind the products and services they use.</p>
            <p>Meeting these demands can be a drag on development, as product, engineering, and data science teams
                implement
                cumbersome and ineffective post-hoc explanatory layers, limit the models and algorithms they use, spend
                time on
                extra documentation, model validation, stress testing, monitoring, and overheads.</p>
            <p>But, done right, agile AI governance can accelerate development, enabling squads to focus on delivering
                value,
                use the full power of their models, and use ongoing validation to improve performance.</p>

                        research was
                        the first to show that explanatory transparency is essential to building AI we can trust.</li>
